A very simple responsive web app that looks good-enough in mobile and desktop. Itâ€™s an app to search for movie titles and make a list of favourites from the results.

To run : npm i && npm start

- State management is accomplished by mobx.
- MUI and Bootstrap is used for user interface.
- Data is fetched from the movie database by axios. ( https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api )
- React hooks and functional approach is used in order to develop components.
- Favourite movies saved into local storage and reloaded from there while opening the app.
